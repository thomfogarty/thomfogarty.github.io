<p>Dear Friends and Family,</p>
<p>Hi! Guess what - we’re getting married! In two weeks!<br/>
<b>Sunday May 31st at 2pm Eastern Time.</b></p>
<p>We know this is a surprise to many of you–but we’ve known that we’ve wanted to get married for a while now. We just don’t want to wait!</p>
<p>SO, we will be having a <small>tiny</small> backyard ceremony at Julie and Mark’s (Zara’s parents) house with the two of us, Remy, Mark, Julie, Lucille (our dog), and a judge that will be 6+ feet away.</p>
<p>We will also be using Zoom so that YOU can be present virtually! We hope that you can join us. It’s not quite the same as actually being together, but it would still mean a lot to us if you could be present in this way. We will start the Zoom gathering at 1:40 so everyone has a chance to get on before we begin at 2. We’ll have a special pre-wedding playlist for you to listen to.</p>
<p>Here is the link and an easy button to add this to your calendar:</p>

</p>
<p>The ceremony will be very short and sweet, likely no longer than 20 minutes.</p>
 
<p>We will have a brief toast (with homemade Kombucha, of course), so please have a glass with the beverage of your choice ready (for locals, Thom highly recommends <a target='_blank' href='https://anthologycoffee.campsite.bio/'>Anthology Coffee</a> or <a target='_blank' href='https://www.casamaraclub.com/'>Casamara Club</a> which you can surprisingly also get at Anthology Coffee).</p>
<p>Love,<br/>
Thom and Zara</p>
